Porting [https://cmu.edu/faces](https://cmu.edu/faces) to React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Partially React

Only changing certain pages in the current (2020-2021) site to React: primarily the film pages. Previous festival pages will remain as they are and be absolute-ly linked to.

## Updating Bootstrap

Current site is a mash of various custom CSS and Bootstrap 4. This site should be Sass and Bootstrap 5.0. Major CSS cleanup.

## It Has Things

react-router for repetitive film pages, react-helmet for heads, react-sass for Sass, and react-snapshot to turn it all into static HTML/CSS to upload to the web host
