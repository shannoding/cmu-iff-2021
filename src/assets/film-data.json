		"aboutFilmDesc": "What makes a neighborhood feel like home? And what happens to that feeling when the neighborhood is threatened by gentrification and horrific violence by outsiders?\nIdrissou Mora-Kpai explores these questions through a focus on the predominantly African-American neighborhood of East Side in Charleston, South Carolina. He gives particular attention to the efforts of corner-store owner, Joe Watson, and his allies to maintain a strong sense of solidarity in the face of poverty, looming displacement, and resurgent racist aggression. Filming over three months in 2015, Mora-Kpai not only illuminates the demanding daily work of community building but also provides an intimate perspective on two killings that brought national attention to the city. Joe Watsonâ€™s store is located on America Street, an apt name for a place long shaped by developments of vital significance well beyond the immediate focus of this film.",
