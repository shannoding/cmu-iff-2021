		"aboutFilmDesc": "What makes a neighborhood feel like home? And what happens to that feeling when the neighborhood is threatened by gentrification and horrific violence by outsiders?\nIdrissou Mora-Kpai explores these questions through a focus on the predominantly African-American neighborhood of East Side in Charleston, South Carolina. He gives particular attention to the efforts of corner-store owner, Joe Watson, and his allies to maintain a strong sense of solidarity in the face of poverty, looming displacement, and resurgent racist aggression. Filming over three months in 2015, Mora-Kpai not only illuminates the demanding daily work of community building but also provides an intimate perspective on two killings that brought national attention to the city. Joe Watsonâ€™s store is located on America Street, an apt name for a place long shaped by developments of vital significance well beyond the immediate focus of this film.",

Black and white Americans move in two different universes in the same country, which the two main characters of Garbage exemplify;, with the Black male seen as an instrument of death and the White woman as a symbol of purity and innocence. Through their interaction, and as their exchange becomes increasingly tense, the audience is taken on a journey that interrogates how white people in America sometimes don't even realize how they've been indoctrinated.",
